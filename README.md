# Sound-Based Computer Automation Using Python

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to automate computer tasks using sound commands. By utilizing Python libraries, we can recognize voice commands and execute corresponding actions on the computer.

## Features

- Voice recognition for specific commands
- Execute actions like opening applications, controlling system volume, etc.
- Customizable command list

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `SpeechRecognition` library
- `pyaudio` for microphone input
- `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech
- `os` for executing system commands

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sound-Based-Computer-Automation-Using-Python.git
   cd Sound-Based-Computer-Automation-Using-Python
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install SpeechRecognition pyaudio pyttsx3
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Speak the command when prompted. Available commands include:

   - "Open browser"
